<p>Machine learning gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitely programmed. It is the ability for computer programs to analyze data, extract information automatically, and learn from it.
So, basically, implementing machine learning means creating algorithm which can learn and make prediction on data.</p>
<p>Some examples of machine learning: 
<ul>
	<li>Amazon's recommendations based on the customer's browsing and purchasing behavior</li>
	<li>Google's search engine that ranks the website by relevancy</li>
	<li>Self-driving car</li>
	<li>Email spam filters</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
	All of the system above learn and improve themselves as more and more data is provided: The more you search and purchase on Amazon, the better recommendations it gives. The more emails you mark as a spam, the better the system filters new emails. The more situations the self driving car navigates, the better it drives
</p>

<p>
	This is very similar to how we humans learn. A typical example is the problem of classification. For instance, the email spam filter needs to classify the spam and not spam emails. Note, that this is quite user dependant. If we know that a specific user is marking all the travel emails as spam, we are going to classify the new emails more effectively. More relevant data leads to better predictions.

<p>Basically, a learner's goal is to generalize from it's experience</p>
